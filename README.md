#CS 61A Assignment-The game of Hog

##Game Rules:

1. **Pig Out**. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1.
2. **Free Bacon**. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the opponent's total score.
3. **Hogtimus Prime**. If a player's score for the turn is a prime number, then the turn score is increased to the next larger prime number. 
4. **Hog Wild**. If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided dice instead of the usual six-sided dice.
5. **Hog Tied**. If the sum of both players' scores ends in a seven (e.g., 17, 27, 57), then the current player can roll at most one dice.
6. **Swine Swap**. After the turn score is added, if the current player's total score contains only one unique digit, the players swap total scores.
